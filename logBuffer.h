/**
 * Collects all data into buf.
 * 
 * Implemented as circular ring buffer:
 * if buf size is reached, first data logged will be overwritten, preceded by "[...]".
 * 
 * To determine max size, use the output of the compiler (memory used).
 * If not fitting, you will get errors like "section ... will not fit in region ..." from the linker.
 * TOCHECK: beware that some memory areas has special purpose, hopefully the compiler will warn?
 * 
 * define-Parameters:
 * <li><code>#define LOGBUF_LENGTH 51200</code> - default is 16 characters (for testing purpose)</li>
 * <li><code>COPY_TO_SERIAL</code> - if defined, logged data will be mirrored via Serial.print</li>
